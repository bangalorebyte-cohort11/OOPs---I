Classes and Methods

**Learning Resources:**

- Think Python Chapters 15,16,17 
- Core Python (Chapter 13 until but not including section 13.11)

**Exercices:**

1) Implement the __sub__, __mul__ and __truediv__  for the Fraction Class

2) Create a user database (login, password, and last login timestamp) class (see Example 7.1. Dictionary Example in Core Python) that manages a system requiring users to log in before access to resources is allowed. This database class has two methods, 1) Update (loading any previously saved user information on instantiation and providing accessor functions to add or update database information). 2) Delete user( This database also supports entries to be deleted)

3) If you complete this, please attempt the Hackerrank challenges on classes.
